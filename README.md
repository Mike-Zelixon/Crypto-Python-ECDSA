# Crypto ECDSA With Python 

Series of Python scripts to highlight how ECDSA works with Bitcoin at a fundamental level from start to finish. 

Includes 3 scripts

The main script named "BTC ECDSA" shows you to take a random seed and turn it into private/public keypair using Elliptic Curve maths and modulation.

It then shows you how to SIGN and VERIFY a digital message using the private/public keypair you generated!   

Most people have trouble understanding how a BTC wallet is generated, let alone the entire ECDSA multiplication process, which is a real mind-melter. 

The truth is that it's a lot like high school math/algebra... but with very large numbers!!! 
Mind bendingly large numbers. Numbers so big it would take you an eternity to count manually. 

My main script breaks this down step by step with comments so that even someone who isn't a math genius may understand the mechanics behind their crypto wallet :)
