# Crypto ECDSA With Python 

Series of Python scripts to highlight how ECDSA works with Bitcoin at a fundamental level from start to finish. 

Includes 3 scripts

1. How to take a random seed and turn it into private/public keypair using Elliptic Curve maths and modulation.
2. How to convert a public & private BTC key into a readable BTC address (WIF).



Most people have trouble understanding how a BTC is generated, let alone the entire ECDSA multiplication process. 

My main script breaks this down step by step with comments so that even someone who isn't a math genius may understand the mechanics behind his crypto wallet :)
