# Crypto ECDSA With Python 

Series of Python scripts to highlight how ECDSA works with Bitcoin at a fundamental level from start to finish. 

Includes 3 scripts

The main script named "BTC ECDSA" shows you to take a random seed and turn it into private/public keypair using Elliptic Curve maths and modulation.

It then shows you how to SIGN and VERIFY a digital message using the private/public keypair you generated!   

Most people have trouble understanding how a BTC wallet is generated, let alone the entire ECDSA multiplication process, which is a real mind-melter. 

The truth is that it's a lot like high school math/algebra... but with very large numbers!!! 

My main script breaks this down step by step with comments so that even someone who isn't a math genius may understand the mechanics behind their crypto wallet :)
